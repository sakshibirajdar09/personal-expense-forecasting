### Step 4: Create the Professional `README.md`

This is the front page of your project. It explains everything you've accomplished.

**Action:** In your main `personal_expense_forecasting` folder, create a file named `README.md` and paste the complete content below into it.

### Step 5: Push Everything to GitHub

This is the final step. Open your terminal (PowerShell) and navigate to your main `personal_expense_forecasting` folder. Run these commands one by one.

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    ```powershell
    git init
    
2.  **Add all your files:**
    ```powershell
    git add .
    
3.  **Make your first commit:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete end-to-end expense forecasting project"
    
4.  **Connect to your GitHub repository:**
    (Copy the URL from the GitHub page you created in Step 2)
    ```powershell
    git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/personal-expense-forecasting.git
    
5.  **Rename your main branch:**
    ```powershell
    git branch -M main
    
6.  **Push your code to GitHub!**
    ```powershell
    git push -u origin main
    
Now, refresh your GitHub repository page. All your files will be there, with your professional `README.md` file beautifully displayed on the front page.

Congratulations! You now have a complete, documented, and version-controlled project ready to be shared or deployed.
